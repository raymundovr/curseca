# About this

‚úçüèΩ This is a project to reflect a series of posts in my personal blog.

[Part I](https://blog.vasquezruiz.me/react-redux-toolkit-saga-i/) where the foundations are layed out.

[Part II](https://blog.vasquezruiz.me/react-redux-toolkit-saga-ii/) where the project setup is explained together with an initial use case and its tests.

[Part III](https://blog.vasquezruiz.me/react-redux-toolkit-saga-iii/) where a second use case is added and its tests.


# Getting Started

Demo project React + Redux + Redux Saga + Jest

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Executes the tests.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
